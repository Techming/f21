Italy,95,80.0,Friulano,Borgo del Tiglio,"Elegance, complexity and structure come together in this drop-dead gorgeous winethat ranks among Italy's greatest whites. It opens with sublime yellow spring flower, aromatic herb and orchard fruit scents. The creamy, delicious palate seamlessly combines juicy white peach, ripe pear and citrus flavors while white almond and savory mineral notes grace the lingering finish."
US,95,48.0,Pinot Noir,Patricia Green Cellars,"From 18-year-old vines, this supple well-balanced effort blends flavors of mocha, cherry, vanilla and breakfast tea. Superbly integrated and delicious even at this early stage, this wine seems destined for a long and savory cellar life. Drink now through 2028."
US,95,48.0,Pinot Noir,Patricia Green Cellars,"A standout even in this terrific lineup of 2015 releases from Patricia Green, the Weber opens with a burst of cola and tobacco scents and accents. It continues, subtle and detailed, with flavors of oranges, vanilla, tea and milk chocolate discreetly threaded through ripe blackberry fruit."
France,95,90.0,Tannat,Vignobles Brumont,This wine is in peak condition. The tannins and the secondary flavors dominate this ripe leather-textured wine. The fruit is all there as well: dried berries and hints of black-plum skins. It is a major wine right at the point of drinking with both the mature flavors and the fruit in the right balance.
US,95,185.0,Pinot Noir,Domaine Serene,"With its sophisticated mix of mineral, acid and tart fruits, this seductive effort pleases from start to finish. Supple and dense, it's got strawberry, blueberry, plum and black cherry, a touch of chocolate, and that underlying streak of mineral. All these elements are in good proportion and finish with an appealing silky texture. It's delicious already, but give it another decade for full enjoyment. Drink now through 2028."
US,95,90.0,Chardonnay,Bergström,"First made in 2006, this succulent luscious Chardonnay is all about minerality. It's got a rich core of butterscotch and the seemingly endless layers of subtle flavors that biodynamic farming can bring. It spends 18 months on the lees prior to bottling. Drink now through 2028."
US,95,325.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hall,"This blockbuster, powerhouse of a wine suggests blueberry pie and chocolate as it opens in the glass. On the palate, it's smooth and seductively silky, offering complex cedar, peppercorn and peppery oak seasonings amidst its dense richness. It finishes with finesse and spice."
Spain,95,80.0,Tempranillo,Valduero,"Nicely oaked blackberry, licorice, vanilla and charred aromas are smooth and sultry. This is an outstanding wine from an excellent year. Forward barrel-spice and mocha flavors adorn core blackberry and raspberry fruit, while this runs long and tastes vaguely chocolaty on the velvety finish. Enjoy this top-notch Tempranillo through 2030."
France,95,290.0,Malbec,Château Lagrézette,"Coming from a seven-acre vineyard named after the dovecote on the property, this is a magnificent wine. Powered by both fruit tannins and the 28 months of new wood aging, it is darkly rich and with great concentration. As a sign of its pedigree, there is also elegance here, a restraint which is new to this wine. That makes it a wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2022."
US,95,75.0,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell,"This fresh and lively medium-bodied wine is beautifully crafted, with cherry blossom aromas and tangy acidity. Layered and seductive, it offers a crisp mix of orange peel, cherry, pomegranate and baking spice flavors that are ready for the table or the cellar."
